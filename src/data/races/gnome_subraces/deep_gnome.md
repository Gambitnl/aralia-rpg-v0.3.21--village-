# Deep Gnome (Subrace) - DEPRECATED

This entry is deprecated. The Deep Gnome is now a standalone race option. Please see the main entry for <span data-term-id="deep_gnome" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Deep Gnome (Svirfneblin)</span>.

**Note for Developers:** This file is obsolete because the Deep Gnome has been implemented as a primary race choice, not a subrace of the standard Gnome, as per the updated source material. The new, active glossary entry is `/public/data/glossary/entries/races/deep_gnome.md`. This file can be safely removed.
