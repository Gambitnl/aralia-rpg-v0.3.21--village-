  description:
    'Towering over most folk, goliaths are distant descendants of giants. Each goliath bears the favors of the first giants—favors that manifest in various supernatural boons, including the ability to quickly grow and temporarily approach the height of goliaths’ gigantic kin. Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they count as kin, goliaths have forged their own path in the multiverse—unencumbered by the internecine conflicts that have ravaged giantkind for ages—and seek heights above those reached by their ancestors.',

    'Creature Type: Humanoid',
    'Size: Medium (about 7–8 feet tall)',
    'Speed: 35 feet',
    'Giant Ancestry: You are descended from Giants. Choose one supernatural boon from your ancestry (Cloud’s Jaunt, Fire’s Burn, Frost’s Chill, Hill’s Tumble, Stone’s Endurance, or Storm’s Thunder). You can use the chosen benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.',
    'Large Form: Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as a Bonus Action if you’re in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have Advantage on Strength checks, and your Speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. (Note: Level-based features are descriptive for now).',
    'Powerful Build: You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the Grappled condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.',
