 * @file SubmapPane.tsx
 * This component displays the visual submap for the player's current
 * world map tile location, showing their precise position within a 25x25 grid.
 * It now features more varied tile visuals, including feature clumping and paths,
 * an icon glossary accessible via a modal, and tooltips with contextual hints.
 * It uses the useSubmapProceduralData hook for data generation and has a decomposed getTileVisuals function.
 * CompassPane is now integrated into this modal.
