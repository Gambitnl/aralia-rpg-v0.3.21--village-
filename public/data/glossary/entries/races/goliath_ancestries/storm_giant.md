This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required). For that duration, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="strength_checks" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength checks</span>, and your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
