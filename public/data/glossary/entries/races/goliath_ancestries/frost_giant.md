## Goliath Traits (Frost Ancestry)

<details>
  <summary>Large Form (Common Goliath Trait)</summary>
  <div>
    <p>Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to <span data-term-id="size" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Large</span> as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> if you’re in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required). For that duration, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="strength_checks" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength checks</span>, and your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>

    <p>When you hit a target with an <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span> and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d6 Cold damage to that target and reduce its <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
