## Goliath Traits (Stone Ancestry)

  <div>
    <p>Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to <span data-term-id="size" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Large</span> as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> if you’re in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required). For that duration, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="strength_checks" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength checks</span>, and your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>

    <p>When you take damage, you can take a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> to roll 1d12.
