# Forest Gnome

Forest gnomes have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness. These gnomes gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using their illusion and trickery to conceal themselves from threats and to mask their homes from detection. They are friendly with good-spirited woodland creatures.
