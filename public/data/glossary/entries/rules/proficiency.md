# Proficiency
<p class="glossary-intro-quote">
Characters and monsters are good at various things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while others can use only a few. Some are better at understanding people’s motives, and others are better at unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All creatures have a <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>, which reflects the impact that training has on the creature’s capabilities.
</p>

This bonus is applied to a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span> when the creature has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or with an item (like a weapon or tool) that the creature uses to make the D20 Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.

<div class="glossary-callout">
  <h4>The Bonus Doesn’t Stack</h4>
  <p>Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll or another number more than once. For example, if a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.</p>
  <p>Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before being added. For example, the <span data-term-id="expertise" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Expertise</span> feature doubles the Proficiency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and divided only once.</p>
