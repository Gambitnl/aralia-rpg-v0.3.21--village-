# Jumping
When you jump, you make either a Long Jump (horizontal) or a High Jump (vertical). 

<details class="feature-card">
  <summary><h3>Long Jump</h3></summary>
  <div>
    <p>When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your <span data-term-id="strength" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength</span> score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
    <p>If you land in <span data-term-id="difficult_terrain" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Difficult Terrain</span>, you must succeed on a DC 10 <span data-term-id="dexterity_acrobatics" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</span> or have the <span data-term-id="prone_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Prone condition</span>.</p>
    <p>This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 <span data-term-id="strength_athletics" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength (Athletics) check</span> to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.</p>

<details class="feature-card">
  <summary><h3>High Jump</h3></summary>
  <div>
    <p>When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your <span data-term-id="strength" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength</span> modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump costs a foot of movement.</p>
    <p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p>
