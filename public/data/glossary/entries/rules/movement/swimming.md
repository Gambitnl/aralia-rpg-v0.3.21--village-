# Swimming
While you’re swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in <span data-term-id="difficult_terrain" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Difficult Terrain</span>). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Swim Speed and use it to swim. At the DM’s option, moving any distance in rough water might require a successful DC 15 <span data-term-id="strength_athletics" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength (Athletics) check</span>.

## Swim Speed
A Swim Speed can be used to swim without expending the extra movement normally associated with swimming.
