# Climbing
While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in <span data-term-id="difficult_terrain" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Difficult Terrain</span>). You ignore this extra cost if you have a Climb Speed and use it to climb.

At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 <span data-term-id="strength_athletics" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength (Athletics) check</span>.
