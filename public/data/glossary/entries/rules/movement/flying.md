# Flying
A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated</span> or <span data-term-id="prone_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Prone condition</span> or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover. See also “<span data-term-id="falling" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Falling</span>”.

## Fly Speed
A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air. While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until you land, fall, or die. See also “<span data-term-id="flying" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Flying</span>” and “<span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span>.”
