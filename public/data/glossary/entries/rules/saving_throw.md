# Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to make a save; you must make one because your character or a monster (if you’re the DM) is at risk. A save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.

If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can choose to fail the save without rolling.

For more details on modifiers, proficiency, and difficulty, see the sub-entries.
