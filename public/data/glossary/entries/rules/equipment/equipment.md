# Equipment
The right equipment can make the difference between success and failure for adventurers. This chapter provides rules and prices for weapons, armor, and other kinds of equipment that characters might purchase or find. The DM lets you know if a shop has an item for sale and whether itâ€™s available at the listed price.
