# Travel
<p class="glossary-intro-quote">
During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The DM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the DM might have you use the travel pace rules below. If you need to know how fast you can move when every second matters, see the movement rules in “Combat” later in this chapter.

<div class="glossary-callout">
  <strong>Marching Order:</strong> The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.
