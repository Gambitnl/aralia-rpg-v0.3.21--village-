# Travel Pace
<p class="glossary-intro-quote">
While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection of mounts for sale). The “DM’s Toolbox” has rules that affect which pace you can choose in certain types of terrain.

| Pace   | Distance Traveled Per... |
|--------|--------------------------|
|        | Minute  | Hour   | Day    |
| Fast   | 400 feet| 4 miles| 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet| 3 miles| 24 miles |
| Slow   | 200 feet| 2 miles| 18 miles |

<p class="mt-4">Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.</p>
