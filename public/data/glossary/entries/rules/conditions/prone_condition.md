# Prone

While you have the Prone condition, you experience the following effects:

*   **Restricted Movement.** Your only movement options are to crawl or to spend an amount of movement equal to half your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> (round down) to right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is 0, you canâ€™t right yourself.
*   **Attacks Affected.** You have <span data-term-id="advantage_disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span>. An <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span> against you has <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, that <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span> has <span data-term-id="advantage_disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span>.
