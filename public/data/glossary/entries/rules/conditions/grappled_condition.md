# Grappled

While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects:

*   **Speed 0.** Your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is 0 and canâ€™t increase.
*   **Attacks Affected.** You have <span data-term-id="advantage_disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> against any target other than the grappler.
*   **Movable.** The grappler can drag or carry you when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 extra foot unless you are <span data-term-id="size" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Tiny</span> or two or more sizes smaller than it.
