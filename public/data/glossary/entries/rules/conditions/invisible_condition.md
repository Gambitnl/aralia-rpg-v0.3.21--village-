# Invisible

While you have the Invisible condition, you experience the following effects:

*   **Surprise.** If you’re Invisible when you roll <span data-term-id="initiative" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Initiative</span>, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on the roll.
*   **Concealed.** You aren’t affected by any effect that requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s creator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also concealed.
*   **Attacks Affected.** <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Attack rolls</span> against you have <span data-term-id="advantage_disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span>, and your <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span>. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t gain this benefit against that creature.
