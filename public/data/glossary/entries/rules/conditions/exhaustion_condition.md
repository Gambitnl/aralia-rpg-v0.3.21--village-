# Exhaustion

While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects:

*   **Exhaustion Levels.** This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
*   **D20 Tests Affected.** When you make a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
*   **Speed Reduced.** Your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
*   **Removing Exhaustion Levels.** Finishing a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.
