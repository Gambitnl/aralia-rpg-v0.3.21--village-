# Unconscious

While you have the Unconscious condition, you experience the following effects:

*   **Inert.** You have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated</span> and <span data-term-id="prone_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Prone</span> conditions, and you drop whatever you’re holding. When this condition ends, you remain Prone.
*   **Speed 0.** Your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is 0 and can’t increase.
*   **Attacks Affected.** <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Attack rolls</span> against you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span>.
*   **Saving Throws Affected.** You automatically fail <span data-term-id="strength_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength</span> and <span data-term-id="dexterity_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dexterity saving throws</span>.
*   **Automatic Critical Hits.** Any <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span> that hits you is a <span data-term-id="critical_hit" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Critical Hit</span> if the attacker is within 5 feet of you.
*   **Unaware.** You’re unaware of your surroundings.
