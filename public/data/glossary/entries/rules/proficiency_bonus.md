# Proficiency Bonus
A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as the character gains levels (described in “Creating a Character”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its <span data-term-id="challenge_rating" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Challenge Rating</span>. The Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is determined.
