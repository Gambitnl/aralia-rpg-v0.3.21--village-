# Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> lets a character add their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span> that use a particular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span> lets you add your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to your Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span>. Some monsters also have <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span>, representing that classâ€™s training in evading or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example, are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saves</span>; they train to resist mental assault.
