# Attack Rolls
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or exceeds the targetâ€™s Armor Class. Attack rolls usually occur in battle, but the DM might also ask for an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery competition.

For more details on modifiers, proficiency, Armor Class, and critical rolls, see the sub-entries.
