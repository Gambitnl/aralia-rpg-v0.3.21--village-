# Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it or by the DM. For example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC is determined by the casterâ€™s spellcasting ability and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call for saves specify the DC.
