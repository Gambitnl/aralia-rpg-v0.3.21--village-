Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a skill proficiency. When you make an ability check with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, your <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.

If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in which you have <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span>. You can’t have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once.
