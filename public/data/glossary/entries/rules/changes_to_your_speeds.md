# Changes to Your Speeds
If an effect increases or decreases your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> is halved and you have a <span data-term-id="flying" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Fly Speed</span>, your Fly Speed is also halved.
