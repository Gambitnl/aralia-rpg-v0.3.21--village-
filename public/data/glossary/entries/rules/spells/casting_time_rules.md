# Casting Time Rules

Most spells require the <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span> to cast, but some spells require a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span>, or 1 minute or more. A spell’s Casting Time entry specifies which of those is required.

    <summary><h3>One Spell with a Spell Slot per Turn</h3></summary>
    <div>
        <p>On a turn, you can expend only one <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> to cast a spell. This rule means you can’t, for example, cast a spell with a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> using the <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span> and another one using a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> on the same turn.</p>

<details class="feature-card" markdown="1">
    <summary><h3>Reaction and Bonus Action Triggers</h3></summary>
    <div>
        <p>A spell that has a casting time of a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> is cast in response to a trigger that is defined in the spell’s Casting Time entry. Some spells that have a casting time of a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> are also cast in response to a trigger defined in the spell.</p>
    </div>

<details class="feature-card" markdown="1">
    <summary><h3>Longer Casting Times</h3></summary>
    <div>
        <p>Certain spells—including a spell cast as a <span data-term-id="ritual" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ritual</span>—require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. While you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 minute or more, you must take the <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span> on each of your turns, and you must maintain <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> (see the <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> rule) while you do so. If your <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. To cast the spell again, you must start over.</p>
