# Spell Level & Slots

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9, which is indicated in a spell’s description. A spell’s level is an indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple spells that can be cast almost by rote—are level 0. The rules for each spellcasting class say when its members gain access to spells of certain levels.

        <p>Spellcasting is taxing, so a spellcaster can cast only a limited number of level 1+ spells before resting. <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell slots</span> are the main way a spellcaster’s magical potential is represented. Each spellcasting class gives its members a limited number of <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> of certain spell levels. For example, a level 3 Wizard has four level 1 <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> and two level 2 slots.</p>
        <p>When you cast a spell, you expend a slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. Imagine a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> is a groove of a certain size—small for a level 1 slot and larger for a higher-level spell. A level 1 spell fits into a slot of any size, but a level 2 spell fits only into a slot that’s at least level 2. So when a level 3 Wizard casts <span data-term-id="magic_missile" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic Missile</span>, a level 1 spell, that Wizard spends one of four level 1 slots and has three remaining.</p>
        <p>Finishing a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> restores any expended <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>

    <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-amber-400">Casting without Slots</summary>
    <div class="pt-2 pl-4">
        <p>There are several ways to cast a spell without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1 text-gray-300 text-sm">
            <li><strong>Cantrips.</strong> A cantrip is cast without a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>.</li>
            <li><strong>Rituals.</strong> Certain spells have the <span data-term-id="ritual" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ritual</span> tag in the <span data-term-id="casting_time_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Casting Time</span> entry. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or it can be cast as a <span data-term-id="ritual" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ritual</span>. The <span data-term-id="ritual" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ritual</span> version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal, but it doesn’t expend a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. To cast a spell as a <span data-term-id="ritual" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ritual</span>, a spellcaster must have it prepared.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Abilities.</strong> Some characters and monsters have special abilities that allow them to cast specific spells without a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. This casting is usually limited in another way, such as being able to cast the spell a limited number of times per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Magic Items.</strong> <span data-term-id="spell_scroll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Scrolls</span> and some other magic items contain spells that can be cast without a <span data-term-id="spell_slot" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. The description of such an item specifies how many times a spell can be cast from it.</li>
        </ul>

    <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-amber-400">Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot</summary>
    <div class="pt-2 pl-4">
        <p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell takes on the higher level for that casting. For instance, if a Wizard casts <span data-term-id="magic_missile" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic Missile</span> using a level 2 slot, that <em>Magic Missile</em> is level 2. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.</p>
        <p>Some spells, such as <span data-term-id="magic_missile" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic Missile</span> and <span data-term-id="cure_wounds" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Cure Wounds</span>, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s description.</p>
