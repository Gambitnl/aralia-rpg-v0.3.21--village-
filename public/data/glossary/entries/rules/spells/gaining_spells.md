# Gaining and Preparing Spells

Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a <span data-term-id="spell_scroll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Scroll</span>. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

### Preparing Spells
If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

#### Spell Preparation by Class
| Class    | Change When You... | Number of Spells |
|----------|--------------------|------------------|
| Bard     | Gain a level       | One              |
| Cleric   | Finish a Long Rest | Any              |
| Druid    | Finish a Long Rest | Any              |
| Paladin  | Finish a Long Rest | One              |
| Ranger   | Finish a Long Rest | One              |
| Sorcerer | Gain a level       | One              |
| Warlock  | Gain a level       | One              |
| Wizard   | Finish a Long Rest | Any              |

Most spellcasting monsters don’t change their lists of prepared spells, but the DM is free to alter them.

### Always-Prepared Spells
Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn’t count against the number of spells on that list.

### Casting in Armor
You must have training with any armor you are wearing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.
