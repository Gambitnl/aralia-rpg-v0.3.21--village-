# Spell Range Rules

A spell’s range indicates how far from the spellcaster the spell’s effect can originate, and the spell’s description specifies which part of the effect is limited by the range.

A range usually takes one of the following forms:

*   **Distance.** The range is expressed in feet.
*   **Touch.** The spell’s effect originates on something, as defined by the spell, that the spellcaster must touch within their reach.
*   **Self.** The spell is cast on the spellcaster or emanates from them, as specified in the spell.

If a spell has movable effects, they aren’t restricted by its range unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
