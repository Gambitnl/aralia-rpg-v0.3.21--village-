# Spell Duration Rules

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists after it is cast. A duration typically takes one of the following forms:

*   **<span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span>.** A duration that requires <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> follows the <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span> rules.
*   **Instantaneous.** An instantaneous duration means the spell’s magic appears only for a moment and then disappears.
*   **Time Span.** A duration that provides a time span specifies how long the spell lasts in rounds, minutes, hours, or the like. For example, a Duration entry might say “1 minute,” meaning the spell ends after 1 minute has passed. While a time-span spell that you cast is ongoing, you can dismiss it (no action required) if you don’t have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>.
