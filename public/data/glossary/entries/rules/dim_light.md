# Dim Light

Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a <span data-term-id="obscured_areas" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Lightly Obscured area</span>. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between <span data-term-id="bright_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bright Light</span> and surrounding <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span>. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light.
