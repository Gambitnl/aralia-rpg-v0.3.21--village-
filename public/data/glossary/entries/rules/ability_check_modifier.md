# Ability Modifier
An ability check is named for the ability modifier it uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so on. Different ability checks are called for in different situations, depending on which ability is most relevant. See the <span data-term-id="ability_check_examples" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ability Check Examples</span> table for examples of each checkâ€™s use.
