# Conditions

<p class="glossary-intro-quote">
Many effects in the game impose a condition, a temporary state that alters the recipient’s capabilities. A condition's definition specifies what happens to its recipient while affected by it, and some conditions apply other conditions.
</p>

The specific conditions, their durations, and how they interact are detailed in the sub-entries in the glossary sidebar.
