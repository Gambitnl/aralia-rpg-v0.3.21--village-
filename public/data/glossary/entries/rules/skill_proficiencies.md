# Skill Proficiencies
Most <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involve using a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, which represents a category of things creatures try to do with an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. The descriptions of the <span data-term-id="actions_in_combat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">actions</span> you take specify which <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> applies if you make an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span> for that <span data-term-id="actions_in_combat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span>, and many other rules note when a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> is relevant. The DM has the ultimate say on whether a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> is relevant in a situation.

If a creature is proficient in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, the creature applies its <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>. Without proficiency in a <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span>, a creature can still make <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability checks</span> involving that <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skill</span> but doesn’t add its <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>. For example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the DM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character has Athletics proficiency, the character adds their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, they make the check without adding their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span>.

### Determining Skills
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in its stat block.

### Skills with Different Abilities
Each skill proficiency is associated with an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. For example, the Intimidation skill is associated with Charisma. In some situations, the DM might allow you to apply your skill proficiency to a different <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span>. For example, if a character tries to intimidate someone through a show of physical strength, the DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check rather than a Charisma (Intimidation) check. That character would make a Strength check and add their <span data-term-id="proficiency_bonus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Proficiency Bonus</span> if they have Intimidation proficiency.
