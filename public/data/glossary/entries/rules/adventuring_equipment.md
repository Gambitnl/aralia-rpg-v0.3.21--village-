# Adventuring Equipment
<p class="glossary-intro-quote">
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are useful on adventures.

  <div class="glossary-example-item">
    <strong>Reaching New Places</strong>
    <span>Use a <span class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ladder</span> to access out-of-the-way locations or a <span class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Torch</span> to perceive things in the dark.</span>
  </div>
  <div class="glossary-example-item">
    <strong>Overcoming Obstacles</strong>
    <span>Bypass locked doors and containers with <span class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Thieves’ Tools</span> or create hazards for pursuers with <span class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Caltrops</span>.</span>

<div class="glossary-callout">
  <strong>Beyond the Battlefield:</strong> The items in the “Tools” and “Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful, but even weapons can be used for more than battle. For example, you could use a <span class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Quarterstaff</span> to push a sinister-looking button you’re reluctant to touch.
