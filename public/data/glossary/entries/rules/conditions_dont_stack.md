# Conditions Don’t Stack

If multiple effects impose the same condition on you, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. Either you have a condition or you don’t.

The <span data-term-id="exhaustion_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Exhaustion</span> condition is an exception; its effects get worse if you have the condition and receive it again.
