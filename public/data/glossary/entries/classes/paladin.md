Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

    <p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. With that pool, you can restore a total number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to five times your Paladin level.</p>
    <p>As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.</p>
    <p>You can also expend 5 <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> from the pool of healing power to remove the <span data-term-id="poisoned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Poisoned condition</span> from the creature; those points don’t also restore <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> to the creature.</p>

<details id="paladin-level-1-spellcasting">
  <summary>Level 1: Spellcasting</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> through prayer and meditation.</p>
    <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Paladin Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. You regain all expended slots when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>
    <p>The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> until the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> can include six Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p>
    <p>If another Paladin feature gives you <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you always have prepared, those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> don’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare with this feature, but those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> otherwise count as Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> for you.</p>
    <p><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong> Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can replace one <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> on your list with another Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Charisma is your <span data-term-id="spellcasting_ability" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spellcasting ability</span> for your Paladin <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>

    <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below.
