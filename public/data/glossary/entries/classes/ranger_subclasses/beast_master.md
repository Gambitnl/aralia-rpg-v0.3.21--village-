## Beast Master Features

<details id="beast-master-level-3-primal-companion">
  <summary>Level 3: Primal Companion</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from your bond with nature. Choose its stat block: Beast of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky. You also determine the kind of animal it is, choosing a kind appropriate for the stat block. Whatever beast you choose, it bears primal markings indicating its supernatural origin.</p>
    <p>The beast is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. It vanishes if you die.</p>
    <h4>The Beast in Combat</h4>
    <p>In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> on its own, but the only <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> it takes is the <span data-term-id="dodge_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dodge action</span> unless you take a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> to command it to take an <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> in its stat block or some other <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span>. You can also sacrifice one of your <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attacks</span> when you take the <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Attack action</span> to command the beast to take the Beast’s Strike <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span>. If you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, the beast acts on its own and isn’t limited to the <span data-term-id="dodge_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dodge action</span>.</p>
    <h4>Restoring or Replacing the Beast</h4>
    <p>If the beast has died within the last hour, you can take a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span> to touch it and expend a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> restored.</p>
    <p>Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can summon a different primal beast, which appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. You choose its stat block and appearance. If you already have a beast from this feature, the old one vanishes when the new one appears.</p>
