# Archfey Patron

**Bargain with Whimsical Fey**

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

## Archfey Features

### Level 3: Archfey Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells                                                                  |

### Level 3: Steps of the Fey
Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast <span data-term-id="misty_step" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Misty Step</span> without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.
In addition, whenever you cast that <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, you can choose one of the following additional effects.
- **Refreshing Step.** Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains 1d10 <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span>.
- **Taunting Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a <span data-term-id="wisdom_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span> or have <span data-term-id="disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

### Level 6: Misty Escape
You can cast <span data-term-id="misty_step" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Misty Step</span> as a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> in response to taking damage.
In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.
- **Disappearing Step.** You have the <span data-term-id="invisible_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Invisible condition</span> until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span>, deal damage, or cast a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>.
- **Dreadful Step.** Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a <span data-term-id="wisdom_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span> or take 2d10 <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span>.

### Level 10: Beguiling Defenses
Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the <span data-term-id="charmed_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Charmed condition</span>.
In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span>, you can take a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a <span data-term-id="wisdom_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span>. On a failed save, the attacker takes <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span> equal to the damage you take. Once you use this <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span>, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> unless you expend a Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 14: Bewitching Magic
Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an <span data-term-id="enchantment_school" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Enchantment</span> or <span data-term-id="illusion_school" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Illusion</span> <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> using an <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> and a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, you can cast <span data-term-id="misty_step" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Misty Step</span> as part of the same <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> and without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>.
