# Great Old One Patron

**Unearth Forbidden Lore of Ineffable Beings**

When you choose this subclass, you might bind yourself to an unspeakable being from the Far Realm or an elder god—a being such as Tharizdun, the Chained God; Zargon, the Returner; Hadar, the Dark Hunger; or Great Cthulhu. Or you might invoke several entities without yoking yourself to one. The motives of these beings are incomprehensible, and the Great Old One might be indifferent to your existence. But the secrets you’ve learned nevertheless allow you to draw strange magic from it.

## Great Old One Features

### Level 3: Awakened Mind
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.
The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Warlock level. It ends early if you use this feature to connect with a different creature.

### Level 3: Great Old One Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Great Old One Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells                                                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3             | Detect Thoughts, Dissonant Whispers, Phantasmal Force, Tasha’s Hideous Laughter |
| 5             | Clairvoyance, Hunger of Hadar                                           |
| 7             | Confusion, Summon Aberration                                            |
| 9             | Modify Memory, Telekinesis                                              |

### Level 3: Psychic Spells
When you cast a Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> that deals damage, you can change its damage type to Psychic. In addition, when you cast a Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> that is an <span data-term-id="enchantment_school" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Enchantment</span> or <span data-term-id="illusion_school" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Illusion</span>, you can do so without <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Verbal</span> or <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Somatic</span> components.

### Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant
When you form a telepathic bond with a creature using your Awakened Mind, you can force that creature to make a <span data-term-id="wisdom_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span>. On a failed save, the creature has <span data-term-id="disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> against you, and you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> against that creature for the duration of the bond.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> unless you expend a Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 10: Eldritch Hex
Your alien patron grants you a powerful curse. You always have the Hex <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> prepared. When you cast Hex and choose an ability, the target also has <span data-term-id="disadvantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Disadvantage</span> on <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span> of the chosen ability for the duration of the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>.

### Level 10: Thought Shield
Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> to <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span>, and whenever a creature deals <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span> to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you take.

### Level 14: Create Thrall
When you cast Summon Aberration, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span>. If you do so, the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell’s</span> duration becomes 1 minute for that casting, and when summoned, the Aberration has a number of <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span> equal to your Warlock level plus your Charisma modifier.
In addition, the first time each turn the Aberration hits a creature under the effect of your Hex, the Aberration deals extra <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span> to the target equal to the bonus damage of that <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>.
