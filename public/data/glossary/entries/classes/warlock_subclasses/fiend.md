# Fiend Patron

**Make a Deal with the Lower Planes**

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

## Fiend Patron Features

### Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
When you reduce an enemy to 0 <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span>, you gain <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span> equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Point</span>). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span>.

### Level 3: Fiend Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared.

| Warlock Level | Spells                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 3             | Burning Hands, Command, Scorching Ray, Suggestion |
| 5             | Fireball, Stinking Cloud                    |
| 7             | Fire Shield, Wall of Fire                   |
| 9             | Geas, Insect Plague                         |

### Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an <span data-term-id="ability_check" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">ability check</span> or a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. You have <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

### Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack roll</span>, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a <span data-term-id="charisma_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Charisma saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span>, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span> if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span> until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> unless you expend a Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.
