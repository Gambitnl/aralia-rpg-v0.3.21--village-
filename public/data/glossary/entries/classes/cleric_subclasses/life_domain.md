# Life Domain

**Soothe the Hurts of the World**

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

    <p>As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your <span data-term-id="channel_divinity_feature" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Channel Divinity</span> to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose <span data-term-id="bloodied" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bloodied</span> creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> among them.

    <p>The healing <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you cast on others heal you as well.

For example, instead of restoring 2d6 <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> to a creature with a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, you restore 12.</p>
