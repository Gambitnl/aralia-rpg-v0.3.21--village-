# Trickery Domain

**Make Mischief and Challenge Authority**

The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.

Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.

  <summary>Level 3: Invoke Duplicity</summary>
  <div>
    <p>As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can expend one use of your <span data-term-id="channel_divinity_feature" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Channel Divinity</span> to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) or have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cast Spells.</strong> You can cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> as though you were in the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses.</li>
      <li><strong>Distract.</strong> When both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="attack_roll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack rolls</span> against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.</li>
      <li><strong>Move.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is within 120 feet of yourself.</li>
