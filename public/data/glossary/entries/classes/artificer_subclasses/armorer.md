## Armorer Features

### Level 3: Tools of the Trade
You gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith’s tools.

### Level 3: Armorer Spells
You always have certain spells prepared, such as *magic missile* and *thunderwave* at 3rd level, and later spells like *lightning bolt* and *wall of force*.

### Level 3: Arcane Armor
As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor. While wearing it, you can use it as a spellcasting focus, and it attaches to you, unable to be removed against your will.

### Level 3: Armor Model
You can customize your Arcane Armor, choosing between the Guardian and Infiltrator models.
- **Guardian:** Features Thunder Gauntlets that deal 1d8 thunder damage and impose disadvantage on attack rolls against other targets. Also provides a Defensive Field for temporary hit points.
- **Infiltrator:** Features a Lightning Launcher that deals 1d6 lightning damage, increases speed by 5 feet, and gives advantage on Stealth checks.

### Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Level 9: Armor Modifications
Your Arcane Armor now counts as separate items (chest piece, boots, helmet, weapon) for the purpose of infusions. You can also infuse two additional items, which must be part of your Arcane Armor.

### Level 15: Perfected Armor
Your armor model gains additional benefits.
- **Guardian:** Can use a reaction to pull a creature up to 25 feet closer and make a melee weapon attack against it.
- **Infiltrator:** Creatures that take lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmer, giving the next attack roll against them advantage.
