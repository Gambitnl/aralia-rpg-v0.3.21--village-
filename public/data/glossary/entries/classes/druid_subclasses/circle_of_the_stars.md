  <div>
    <p>Youâ€™ve created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a <span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span> for your Druid <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one.</p>
    <p>While holding the map, you have the <span data-term-id="guidance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Guidance</span> and <span data-term-id="guiding_bolt" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Guiding Bolt</span> <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared, and you can cast <span data-term-id="guiding_bolt" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Guiding Bolt</span> without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
    <p>If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, and it destroys the previous map.</p>

  <summary>Level 3: Starry Form</summary>
  <div>
    <p>As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting.</p>
    <p>While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds <span data-term-id="bright_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bright Light</span> in a 10-foot radius and <span data-term-id="dim_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dim Light</span> for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, or use this feature again.</p>
    <p>Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archer.</strong> A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.</li>
      <li><strong>Chalice.</strong> A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> using a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> that restores <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.</li>
      <li><strong>Dragon.</strong> A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> to maintain <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span>, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whenever you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you gain access to a special <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weal (Even).</strong> Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>, you can take a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> to roll 1d6 and add the number rolled to the total.</li>
      <li><strong>Woe (Odd).</strong> Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>, you can take a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> to roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the total.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use this <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>

    <p>The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a <span data-term-id="fly_speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Fly Speed</span> of 20 feet and can hover.</p>
    <p>Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body.</p>
