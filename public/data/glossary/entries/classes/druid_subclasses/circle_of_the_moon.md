# Circle of the Moon

**Adopt Animal Forms to Guard the Wilds**

Druids of the Circle of the Moon draw on lunar magic to transform themselves. Their order gathers under the moon to share news and perform rituals.

Changeable as the moon, a Druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and then crash through undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the Druid’s blood.
