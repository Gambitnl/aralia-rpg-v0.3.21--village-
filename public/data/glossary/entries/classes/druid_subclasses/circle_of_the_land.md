# Circle of the Land

**Celebrate Connection to the Natural World**

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

### Level 3: Land’s Aid
As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span>, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

### Level 6: Natural Recovery
You can cast one of the level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, and you must finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>, you can choose expended <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> to recover. The <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. You can recover a level 3 <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, a level 2 and a level 1 <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, or three level 1 <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>. Once you recover <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 10: Nature’s Ward
You are immune to the <span data-term-id="poisoned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Poisoned condition</span>, and you have <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

| Land Type | Resistance  |
|-----------|-------------|
| Arid      | Fire        |
| Polar     | Cold        |
| Temperate | Lightning   |
| Tropical  | Poison      |

### Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary
As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span> or die. You and your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and your allies gain the current <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> of your Nature’s Ward while there.

As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.
