# Circle of the Sea

**Become One with Tides and Storms**

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of natureâ€™s wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

    <p>As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot <span data-term-id="emanation_area" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Emanation</span> that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>.</p>
    <p>When you manifest the Emanation and as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the Emanation. The target must succeed on a Constitution <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span> or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).</p>

    <p>Instead of manifesting the Emanation of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself.

    <p>In addition, you can manifest the Emanation around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.</p>
