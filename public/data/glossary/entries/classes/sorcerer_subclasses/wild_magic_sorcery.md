# Wild Magic

**Unleash Chaotic Magic**

Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.

## Wild Magic Features

### Level 3: Wild Magic Surge
Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.
If the magical effect is a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, it is too wild to be affected by your <span data-term-id="metamagic_feature" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Metamagic</span>.

### Level 3: Tides of Chaos
You can manipulate chaos itself to give yourself <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on one <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span> before you roll the d20. Once you do so, you must cast a Sorcerer <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> or finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> before you can use this feature again.
If you do cast a Sorcerer <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> before you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>, you automatically roll on the Wild Magic Surge table.

### Level 6: Bend Luck
You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. Immediately after another creature you can see rolls the d20 for a <span data-term-id="d20_test" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">D20 Test</span>, you can take a <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> and spend 1 Sorcery Point to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the d20 roll.

### Level 14: Controlled Chaos
You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.

### Level 18: Tamed Surge
Immediately after you cast a Sorcerer <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, you can create an effect of your choice from the Wild Magic Surge table instead of rolling on that table. You can choose any effect in the table except for the final row, and if the chosen effect involves a roll, you must make it.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.
