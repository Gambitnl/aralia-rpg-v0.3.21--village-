# Draconic Sorcery

**Breathe the Magic of Dragons**

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

## Draconic Sorcery Features

### Level 3: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base <span data-term-id="armor_class" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Armor Class</span> equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

### Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared.

<div class="not-prose my-4">
  <table class="min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-600 border border-gray-600 rounded-lg shadow-md">
    <caption class="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-300 p-2 bg-gray-700/50 rounded-t-lg">Draconic Spells</caption>
    <thead class="bg-gray-700/50">
      <tr>
        <th scope="col" class="px-4 py-3 text-left text-xs font-medium text-sky-300 uppercase tracking-wider border-b border-gray-600">Sorcerer Level</th>
        <th scope="col" class="px-4 py-3 text-left text-xs font-medium text-sky-300 uppercase tracking-wider border-b border-gray-600">Prepared Spells</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class="bg-gray-800/50 divide-y divide-gray-700">
      <tr><td>3</td><td>Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Command, Dragon’s Breath</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>Fear, Fly</td></tr>
      <tr><td>7</td><td>Arcane Eye, Charm Monster</td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>Legend Lore, Summon Dragon</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Level 6: Elemental Affinity
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> to that damage type, and when you cast a <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>.

### Level 14: Dragon Wings
As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required). For the <span data-term-id="spell_duration_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">duration</span>, you have a <span data-term-id="fly_speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Fly Speed</span> of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 18: Dragon Companion
You can cast Summon Dragon without a <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Material component</span>. You can also cast it once without a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.
Whenever you start casting the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require <span data-term-id="concentration" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Concentration</span>. If you do so, the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell’s</span> <span data-term-id="spell_duration_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">duration</span> becomes 1 minute for that casting.
