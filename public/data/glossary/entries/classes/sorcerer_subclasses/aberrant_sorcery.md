# Aberrant Mind

**Wield Unnatural Psionic Power**

An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a terror to those who feel the stab of your mind?

Perhaps a psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you, or you were exposed to the Far Realm’s warping influence. Alternatively, you were implanted with a mind flayer tadpole, but your transformation into a mind flayer never occurred; now the tadpole’s psionic power is yours. However you acquired this power, your mind is aflame with it.

## Aberrant Mind Features

### Level 3: Psionic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Psionic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> prepared.
<div class="not-prose my-4">
  <table class="min-w-full divide-y divide-gray-600 border border-gray-600 rounded-lg shadow-md">

</div>

### Level 3: Telepathic Speech
You can form a telepathic connection between your mind and the mind of another. As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You and the chosen creature can communicate telepathically with each other while the two of you are within a number of miles of each other equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 mile). To understand each other, you each must mentally use a language the other knows.
The telepathic connection lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Sorcerer level. It ends early if you use this ability to form a connection with a different creature.

### Level 6: Psionic Sorcery
When you cast any level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> from your Psionic Spells feature, you can cast it by expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> as normal or by spending a number of Sorcery Points equal to the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>’s level. If you cast the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> using Sorcery Points, it requires no <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Verbal</span> or <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Somatic</span> components, and it requires no <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Material components</span> unless they are consumed by the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> or have a cost specified in it.

### Level 6: Psychic Defenses
You have <span data-term-id="resistance" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Resistance</span> to <span data-term-id="psychic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Psychic damage</span>, and you have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throws</span> to avoid or end the <span data-term-id="charmed_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Charmed</span> or <span data-term-id="frightened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Frightened</span> condition.

### Level 14: Revelation in Flesh
You can unleash the aberrant truth hidden within yourself. As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point or more to magically alter your body for 10 minutes. For each Sorcery Point you spend, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the alteration ends.
*   **Aquatic Adaptation.** You gain a <span data-term-id="swim_speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Swim Speed</span> equal to twice your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span>, and you can breathe underwater. Gills grow from your neck or flare behind your ears, and your fingers become webbed or you grow wriggling cilia.
*   **Glistening Flight.** You gain a <span data-term-id="fly_speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Fly Speed</span> equal to your <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span>, and you can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus or otherworldly light.
*   **See the Invisible.** You can see any <span data-term-id="invisible_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Invisible</span> creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind <span data-term-id="total_cover" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Total Cover</span>. Your eyes also turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils.
*   **Wormlike Movement.** Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or the <span data-term-id="grappled_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Grappled condition</span>.

### Level 18: Warping Implosion
You can unleash a space-warping anomaly. As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a <span data-term-id="strength_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength saving throw</span> against your <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span>. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 <span data-term-id="force_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Force damage</span> and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> unless you spend 5 Sorcery Points (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required) to restore your use of it.
