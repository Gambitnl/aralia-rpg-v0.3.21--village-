Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section.
**Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.
**Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

### Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.
**Cantrips.** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice. When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.
**Spell Slots.** The Warlock Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short</span> or <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.
**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>. The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. If another Warlock feature gives you <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that you always have prepared, those <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> don’t count against the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> you can prepare.
**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> on your list with another Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> of an eligible level.
**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is the <span data-term-id="spellcasting_ability" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spellcasting ability</span> for your Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.
**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a <span data-term-id="spellcasting_focus" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spellcasting Focus</span> for your Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.

### Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice.

### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the <span data-term-id="ability_score_improvement_feat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Ability Score Improvement feat</span> or another <span data-term-id="feat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">feat</span> of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

### Level 9: Contact Patron
You always have the Contact Other Plane <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span> to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell’s</span> <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. Once you cast the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> once without expending a <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slot</span>, and you must finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span> before you can cast it in this way again. You gain another Warlock <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7), 15 (level 8), and 17 (level 9).

### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an <span data-term-id="epic_boon_feat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Epic Boon feat</span> or another <span data-term-id="feat" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">feat</span> of your choice for which you qualify.

### Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.
