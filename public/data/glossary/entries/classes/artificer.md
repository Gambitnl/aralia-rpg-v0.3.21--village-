# Artificer

Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist’s supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher’s supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker’s tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

## Artificer Class Features

### Level 1: Magical Tinkering
You learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:
- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early. You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Level 1: Spellcasting
You’ve studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects.
- **Tools Required:** You must have a spellcasting focus—thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this feature.
- **Cantrips:** You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list.
- **Spell Slots:** You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
- **Preparing and Casting Spells:** You prepare a list of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level (rounded down).
- **Spellcasting Ability:** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells.
- **Ritual Casting:** You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Level 2: Infuse Item
You gain the ability to imbue mundane items with magical infusions. You learn four infusions of your choice. You can infuse a nonmagical object whenever you finish a long rest. See the Artificer Infusions entry for details.

### Level 3: Artificer Specialist
You choose a specialization for your craft. Choose from Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed in a separate entry.

### Level 3: The Right Tool for the Job
You learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work. The tools vanish when you use this feature again.

### Level 6: Tool Expertise
Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

### Level 7: Flash of Genius
When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 10: Magic Item Adept
You can attune to up to four magic items at once. If you craft a common or uncommon magic item, it takes you a quarter of the time and costs half the gold.

### Level 11: Spell-Storing Item
You learn how to store a spell in an object. When you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or an item you can use as a spellcasting focus and store a 1st- or 2nd-level artificer spell in it. A creature holding the object can use an action to produce the spell’s effect. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier or until you use this feature again.

### Level 14: Magic Item Savant
You can attune to up to five magic items at once. You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

### Level 18: Magic Item Master
You can attune to up to six magic items at once.

### Level 20: Soul of Artifice
You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to. If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead.
