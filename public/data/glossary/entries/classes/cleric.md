Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> through prayer and meditation. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>, which appear on the <span data-term-id="cleric_spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Cleric spell list</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know three <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrips</span> of your choice from the Cleric <span data-term-id="spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell list</span>.</p>
    <p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrips</span> with another <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrip</span> of your choice from the Cleric <span data-term-id="spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell list</span>.</p>
    <p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrip</span> of your choice from the Cleric <span data-term-id="spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell list</span>, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Slots</span>.</strong> The Cleric Features table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.

    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature.

    <p>The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table.

  <summary>Level 2: Channel Divinity</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>
    <p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.</p>
    <p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, the DC equals the <span data-term-id="spell_save_dc" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell save DC</span> from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>
    <p><strong>Divine Spark.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>
    <p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>
    <p><strong>Turn Undead.</strong> As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>. If the creature fails its save, it has the <span data-term-id="frightened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Frightened</span> and <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated</span> conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, or if you die.</p>
