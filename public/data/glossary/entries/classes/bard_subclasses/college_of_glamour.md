# College of Glamour

**Weave Beguiling Fey Magic**

The College of Glamour traces its origins to the beguiling magic of the Feywild. Bards who study this magic weave threads of beauty and terror into their songs and stories, and the mightiest among them can cloak themselves in otherworldly majesty. Their performances stir up wistful longing for forgotten innocence, evoke unconscious memories of long-held fears, and tug at the emotions of even the most hard-hearted listeners.

On a failed save, the target has the <span data-term-id="charmed_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Charmed</span> or <span data-term-id="frightened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Frightened</span> condition (your choice) for 1 minute.

    <p>You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor.

When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your <span data-term-id="charisma" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Charisma</span> modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of those creatures gains a number of <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span> equal to two times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each can use its <span data-term-id="reaction" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Reaction</span> to move up to its <span data-term-id="speed" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Speed</span> without provoking <span data-term-id="opportunity_attack" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Opportunity Attacks</span>.</p>
