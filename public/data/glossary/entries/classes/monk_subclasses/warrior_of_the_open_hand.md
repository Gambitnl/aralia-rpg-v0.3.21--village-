## Warrior of the Open Hand Features

### Level 3: Open Hand Technique
Whenever you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack</span> granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.
*   **Addle.** The target can’t make <span data-term-id="opportunity_attack" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Opportunity Attacks</span> until the start of its next turn.
*   **Push.** The target must succeed on a <span data-term-id="strength" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Strength</span> <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span> or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
*   **Topple.** The target must succeed on a <span data-term-id="dexterity_saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dexterity saving throw</span> or have the <span data-term-id="prone_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Prone condition</span>.

### Level 6: Wholeness of Body
You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to the number rolled plus your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier (minimum of 1 <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Point</span> regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 11: Fleet Step
When you take a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>.

### Level 17: Quivering Palm
You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strike</span>, you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> to end them. Alternatively, when you take the <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Attack action</span> on your turn, you can forgo one of the <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attacks</span> to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a <span data-term-id="constitution" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Constitution</span> <span data-term-id="saving_throw" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">saving throw</span>, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no <span data-term-id="action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">action</span> required).
