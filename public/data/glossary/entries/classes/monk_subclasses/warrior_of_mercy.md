**Manipulate Forces of Life and Death**

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death.

## Warrior of Mercy Features

### Level 3: Hand of Harm
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strike</span> and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra <span data-term-id="necrotic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Necrotic damage</span> equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier.

### Level 3: Hand of Healing
As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier.

When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strikes</span> with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.

### Level 3: Implements of Mercy
You gain <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span> in the <span data-term-id="insight" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Insight</span> and <span data-term-id="medicine" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Medicine</span> <span data-term-id="skills_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">skills</span> and <span data-term-id="proficiency" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">proficiency</span> with the <span data-term-id="herbalism_kit" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Herbalism Kit</span>.

### Level 6: Physician’s Touch
Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.

**Hand of Harm.** When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the <span data-term-id="poisoned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Poisoned condition</span> until the end of your next turn.

**Hand of Healing.** When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: <span data-term-id="blinded_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Blinded</span>, <span data-term-id="deafened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Deafened</span>, <span data-term-id="paralyzed_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Paralyzed</span>, <span data-term-id="poisoned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Poisoned</span>, or <span data-term-id="stunned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Stunned</span>.

### Level 11: Flurry of Healing and Harm
When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strikes</span> with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strike</span> with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.

### Level 17: Hand of Ultimate Mercy
Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span>, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of <span data-term-id="hit_points" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hit Points</span> equal to 4d10 plus your <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: <span data-term-id="blinded_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Blinded</span>, <span data-term-id="deafened_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Deafened</span>, <span data-term-id="paralyzed_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Paralyzed</span>, <span data-term-id="poisoned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Poisoned</span>, and <span data-term-id="stunned_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Stunned</span>.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.
