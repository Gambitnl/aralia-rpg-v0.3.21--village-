## Warrior of Shadow Features

### Level 3: Shadow Arts
You have learned to draw on the power of the Shadowfell, gaining the following benefits.

**Darkness.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to cast the <span data-term-id="darkness_spell" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span> <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> without <span data-term-id="spell_components_rules" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell components</span>. You can see within the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spellâ€™s</span> area when you cast it with this feature. While the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> persists, you can move its area of <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span> to a space within 60 feet of yourself at the start of each of your turns.

**<span data-term-id="darkvision" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkvision</span>.** You gain <span data-term-id="darkvision" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkvision</span> with a range of 60 feet. If you already have <span data-term-id="darkvision" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkvision</span>, its range increases by 60 feet.

**Shadowy Figments.** You know the <span data-term-id="minor_illusion" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Minor Illusion</span> <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>. <span data-term-id="wisdom" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wisdom</span> is your <span data-term-id="spellcasting_ability" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spellcasting ability</span> for it.

### Level 6: Shadow Step
While entirely within <span data-term-id="dim_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dim Light</span> or <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span>, you can use a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span> to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in <span data-term-id="dim_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dim Light</span> or <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span>. You then have <span data-term-id="advantage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Advantage</span> on the next melee <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack</span> you make before the end of the current turn.

### Level 11: Improved Shadow Step
You can draw on your Shadowfell connection to empower your teleportation. When you use your Shadow Step, you can expend 1 Focus Point to remove the requirement that you must start and end in <span data-term-id="dim_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dim Light</span> or <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span> for that use of the feature. As part of this <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, you can make an <span data-term-id="unarmed_strike" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Unarmed Strike</span> immediately after you teleport.

### Level 17: Cloak of Shadows
As a <span data-term-id="magic_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Magic action</span> while entirely within <span data-term-id="dim_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Dim Light</span> or <span data-term-id="darkness" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Darkness</span>, you can expend 3 Focus Points to shroud yourself with shadows for 1 minute, until you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>, or until you end your turn in <span data-term-id="bright_light" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bright Light</span>. While shrouded by these shadows, you gain the following benefits.
*   **Invisibility.** You have the <span data-term-id="invisible_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Invisible condition</span>.
*   **Partially Incorporeal.** You can move through occupied spaces as if they were <span data-term-id="difficult_terrain" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Difficult Terrain</span>. If you end your turn in such a space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you were in.
*   **Shadow Flurry.** You can use your Flurry of Blows without expending any Focus Points.
