### Level 3: Second-Story Work

*   **Jumper.** You can determine your <span data-term-id="jump" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">jump</span> distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

### Level 9: Supreme Sneak
You gain the following Cunning Strike option.
*   **Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6).** If you have the <span data-term-id="hide_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Hide action’s</span> <span data-term-id="invisible_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Invisible condition</span>, this <span data-term-id="attack_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">attack</span> doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the turn behind <span data-term-id="three_quarters_cover" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Three-Quarters Cover</span> or <span data-term-id="total_cover" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Total Cover</span>.

### Level 13: Use Magic Device

*   **Attunement.** You can attune to up to four <span data-term-id="magic_items" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">magic items</span> at once.
*   **Charges.** Whenever you use a <span data-term-id="magic_items" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">magic item</span> property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.
*   **Scrolls.** You can use any <span data-term-id="spell_scroll" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Scroll</span>, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span>.

On a successful check, you cast the <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell</span> from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

You take your first turn at your normal <span data-term-id="initiative" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Initiative</span> and your second turn at your <span data-term-id="initiative" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Initiative</span> minus 10.
