## Psi Warrior Features

<details id="psi-warrior-level-3-psionic-power">
  <summary>Level 3: Psionic Power</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior Energy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.</p>
    <h4>Psi Warrior Energy Dice</h4>
| Fighter Level | Die Size | Number |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| 3             | D6       | 4      |
| 5             | D8       | 6      |
| 9             | D8       | 8      |
| 11            | D10      | 8      |
| 13            | D10      | 10     |
| 17            | D12      | 12     |
    <p>Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.</p>
    <p>You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>, and you regain all of them when you finish a <span data-term-id="long_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Long Rest</span>.</p>
