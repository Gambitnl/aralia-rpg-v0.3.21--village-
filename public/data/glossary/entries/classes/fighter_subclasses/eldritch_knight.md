# Eldritch Knight

**Support Combat Skills with Arcane Magic**

Their <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> both complement and extend their combat skills, providing additional protection to shore up their armor and also allowing them to engage many foes at once with explosive magic.

  <div>
    <p>You have learned to cast <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You know two <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrips</span> of your choice from the <span data-term-id="wizard_spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wizard spell list</span>. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrips</span> with another <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrip</span> of your choice from the <span data-term-id="wizard_spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wizard spell list</span>. When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard <span data-term-id="cantrip" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">cantrip</span> of your choice.</p>
    <p><strong><span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Spell Slots</span>.</strong> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span> you have to cast your level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span>.

    <p><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> that are available for you to cast with this feature.

The number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> from the <span data-term-id="wizard_spell_list" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Wizard spell list</span> until the number of <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen <span data-term-id="spells_chapter" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spells</span> must be of a level for which you have <span data-term-id="spell_level_slots" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">spell slots</span>.</p>

  <summary>Level 3: War Bond</summary>
  <div>
    <p>You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a <span data-term-id="short_rest" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Short Rest</span>. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a <span data-term-id="magic_items" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">magic item</span> to which someone else is attuned.</p>
    <p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the <span data-term-id="incapacitated_condition" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Incapacitated condition</span>. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
    <p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a <span data-term-id="bonus_action" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Bonus Action</span>. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
