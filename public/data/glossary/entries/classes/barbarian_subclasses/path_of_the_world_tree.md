# Path of the World Tree

**Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse**

Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span>. This tree grows among the <span data-term-id="outer_planes" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Outer Planes</span>, connecting them to each other and the <span data-term-id="material_plane" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Material Plane</span>. These Barbarians draw on the tree’s magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.

    <p>Your <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span> taps into the life force of the World Tree. You gain the following benefits.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vitality Surge.</strong> When you activate your <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span>, you gain a number of <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span> equal to your Barbarian level.</li>
      <li><strong>Life-Giving Force.</strong> At the start of each of your turns while your <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span> is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span>. To determine the number of <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span>, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these <span data-term-id="temporary_hp" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Temporary Hit Points</span> remain when your <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span> ends, they vanish.</li>
