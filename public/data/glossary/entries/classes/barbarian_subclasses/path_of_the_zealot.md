They are often allies to the priests and other followers of their god or pantheon.

The extra damage is <span data-term-id="necrotic_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Necrotic</span> or <span data-term-id="radiant_damage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Radiant</span>; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.</p>
