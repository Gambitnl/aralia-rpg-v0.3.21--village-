# Path of the Berserker

**Channel Rage into Violent Fury**

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span> primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their <span data-term-id="rage" class="glossary-term-link-from-markdown">Rage</span> to seize and empower them.
